# 10 x 10 tracker app

This app request the list of your 10 x 10 boardgames and provides information about how many times you have played that game
The app retrieves the information from BGG

## Why do this?

Same reason of everything I do on Github. Learn

##Â WIP

This APP is still in work in progress.
Main components and redux layout is already in place but it requires a bit of plugging things

Things you will not found yet
- Styles for the APP
- The final page where you have your games and play counts
- The final games stored in local storage for fast load + also pwa
- React router to allow that final page 

### Notes
The home will request your BGG game and retrieve your collection of games
NOTE: since the collection can be processed on the background we will display the TOP games meanwhile.

You choose the games that are part of your 10 x 10 and when done "submit"
It will create a link where you can see that 10 games and how many times you have played them this year
